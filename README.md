# DockerTierCraft 

An interactive guide to Docker-based persistence and three-tier architecture using MySQL and WordPress.

## Overview

Understand how to persist data in Docker containers and set up a three-tier architecture (Database → App → Client) using volumes and bind mounts. This project is ideal for DevOps learning and real-world deployments.

---

##  Why This Matters

- Containers are ephemeral—without persistence, data is lost after exit or removal.
- Persistent storage (volumes/mounts) ensures data survives container lifecycle.
- Three-tier architecture mirrors production setups: separate database and app tiers, accessed by clients via networking.
